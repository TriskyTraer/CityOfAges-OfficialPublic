Multiuser Dungeon, Text environment with some BMP graphics,
City of Ages is a 1997 project written by Darren N Lory in Visual Basic 6.
Visual Basic 6 converts to a string protected environment converted into
Visual C++ script. This code [in the format of main.c] is then compiled as
if it were in a protected shield (no crashing to blue screen) environment.
Ultimately we now  have a 32 bit EXE native code, that will never crash.
I challenge anyone to create a grand graphical user interface for this MUD.
It was tweeked to have all the commands you need to run a pretty addictive game.

Vote for us at Steampowered.com it motivates us to code more and bring
you new designs. Our game has one of every joke, every idea possible, even:
Elvis our GURU, roulette on command, horse racing on command,
a working Arcade machine with Tools>Joystick control, go play Packmon, and
discover a mini-AOL machine we made, ascii popup pictures, and more!
