Multiuser Dungeon, Text environment with some BMP graphics,
City of Ages is a 1997 project written by Darren N Lory in Visual Basic 6.
Visual Basic 6 converts to a string protected environment converted into
Visual C++ script. This code [in the format of main.c] is then compiled as
if it were in a protected shield (no crashing to blue screen) environment.
Ultimately we now  have a 32 bit EXE native code, that will never crash.
I challenge anyone to create a grand graphical user interface for this MUD.
It was tweeked to have all the commands you need to run a pretty addictive game.
