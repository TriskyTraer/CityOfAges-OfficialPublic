PORTS
===========================================================================================
CoA uses port 23 the default telnet port but it also has one dynamic port you can change!
This dynamic port was originally created for those in the military that have telnet access
but on a different and secured port, also if you have a server with a company they might assign you
a port and it won't be their main port 23 which they probably use for internal reasons.
If you change this default port keep in mind to relaunch CoA.

SOURCE CODE DISCLAIMER
===========================================================================================
After the year 2037 You can use this code as opensource for your own personal or commercial
requirements. Hopefully I get my $6000 in hardware that burnt out coding and running this MUD,
before you make yours. :)

For now you may distribute the coaclient.exe and its installation coasetup.exe so your players can play,
keep the source code to yourself, however. You may sell items and housing in the game as you wish,
to generate some money for yourself, meanwhile.

Enjoy my work! Try not to remove my name and pictures of me from anything.

You can get ahold of me directly at formsmatter@gmail.com I do not mind helping individials so
do not be worried about contacting me even to, say 'hi', I am all about the player base.
